Over the course of approximately 3-4 months, I created a website for AJ Enos and Charles Wildes IV in order to help 
promote their FIRST app. I created this website while finishing up the second semester of my Junior year at Bucknell
University, and worked closely with my client to see the feel they were going for.

The link for the site is as follows: firstserviceapp.com

** Disclaimer: I do not work on the site for AJ Enos and Charles Wildes IV anymore. Any changes made to the site, for 
better or worse, are not reflective of the site I originally gave them.
